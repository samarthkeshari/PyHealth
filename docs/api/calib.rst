Calibration and Uncertainty Quantification
===============

In this module, we implemented the following prediction
set constructors or model calibration methods, which can be
combined with any PyHealth models.

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 3

    calib/pyhealth.calib.calibration

    calib/pyhealth.calib.predictionset


The model calibration methods:
.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 3
    calib/pyhealth.calib.calibration.KCal
    calib/pyhealth.calib.calibration.HistogramBinning
    calib/pyhealth.calib.calibration.TemperatureScaling

The prediction set constructors:
.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 3
    calib/pyhealth.calib.predictionset.LABEL
    calib/pyhealth.calib.predictionset.SCRIB
